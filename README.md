15-112 Project
Description 
I will be creating a simple flash-style side scrolling game inspired by Yasser el Sayed’s “a byte to eat.”  My project will be similar to this game with some other unique features. The objective of the game will be to make it past obstacles as a character who’s only controls are to move left/right and jump. There will be a unique feature that allows you to “switch” the color of the background of the game by switching colors, parts of the stage which may have been hidden before may become revealed. This is the main basis of my game. Imagine the endpoint being too far up to jump in a single jump. At first it may appear there is no way to make it to the goal. However, after switching colors, you may reveal a platform that was blending in to the background which will allow you to complete the level. This will be the main basis of this color switching game I call “switch”  
Libraries
Tkinter – to display the game 
Pygame – make it easier to create a game 
Others – there may be other libraries that I may decide to use when I start coding 
UI
The user interface will be like most games. At the beginning there will simply be a start button. During the game upon a specific key press, the game will get paused and give you the option to quit or to return to the home screen 
Initial features/First checkpoint
For the first checkpoint I will have the start screen along with perhaps a few levels. I will have implemented the “switch” ability and will have introduced some obstacles like platforms, holes or spikes  
Final features
This will be the completed game with at least 10 different levels with a range of difficulty. There will be many different obstacles and the UI will be refreshed/cleaned up 
Unique features
The unique feature of my game will be the “switch” ability that will allow more variety and bring a unique twist to the side scrolling flash game genre. The ability will force player to think outside the box and come up with unique ways to pass the levels while utilizing all the different feature the game has to offer. The player will need to utilize all the features of the game in different combinations to be able to pass the levels.
